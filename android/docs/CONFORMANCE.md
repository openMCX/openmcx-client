# Android client: conformance

For each requirement this lists the clause, the code that implements it, and the evidence that it works. The evidence
is a JVM unit test (`core/src/test`), an instrumented test (`app/src/androidTest`) or a check in the Android-only lab
scenarios (`tests/scenarios.py`, S1–S11). Paths are relative to `android/`. Clause numbers are from ETSI TS 124 379 and TS 124 282 V19.7.0. Clauses of TS 24.380, 24.482 and 24.484 are cited from
the published specifications and not re-checked against a local copy; they are marked *(not checked locally)*.

## Keeping registered

| Requirement | Clause | Code | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| One outbound flow. Requests to the UE arrive on it; the UE never listens | RFC 5626 §4, §5 | `sip/Flow.kt`, `UserAgent` (`.invalid` sent-by) | S1–S11 (the lab overlay never dials a client) |

| Re-register on a new flow with the same instance and reg-id, then subscribe and affiliate again | RFC 5626 §4.2 | `McxClient.run`, `reconnect` | S7 (dropped flow, coverage loss) |
| Registration, subscription and token refresh; re-authorisation with SIP-If-Match | RFC 3261 §10.2.4, RFC 3903 §4.4, TS 24.379 §7.2.2 | `McxClient.housekeeping`, `refreshNow` | S7 |
| Reconnect when the default network changes | RFC 5626 §4.4 | `app/…/McxService.watchNetwork` | Not exercised: redroid cannot change networks |
| Always on: sticky foreground service, start at boot | TS 23.280 §10.2 | `McxService`, `BootReceiver` | S8 (Doze, process killed) |

## MCPTT

| Requirement | Clause | Code | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private call, originating: INVITE to the PSI with mcptt-info (`private`, client ID), resource-lists, Answer-Mode or Priv-Answer-Mode | TS 24.379 §11.1.1.2.1.1 | `McpttService.originate` | S2, S3 |

| Prearranged group call, originating and terminating | TS 24.379 §10.1.1.2.1 | `McpttService` | S4 |
| Ad hoc group call; the group identity comes from `mcptt-calling-group-id` | TS 24.379 §17.2.2.1 | `McpttService` | S5 |
| Release: BYE (with Reason for ad hoc), or CANCEL before the answer | TS 24.379 §6.2.4, §17.2.3.1.1 | `McpttService.hangup` | S2–S5 |
| Session timer; refresh by UPDATE (as UAS we are the refresher) | RFC 4028, TS 24.379 §6.2.3.1.1 step 5 | `McpttService.startRefresh` | S7 (an 80 s private call; bob's UPDATE refresh gets 200 and the call outlives the server's roughly 60 s session timer) |
| SDP: one AMR-WB stream and `m=application … udp MCPTT` with `mc_floor_ssrc`; an offered `mc_priority` is echoed | TS 24.379 §6.2.1, §6.2.2; TS 24.380 §14 *(not checked locally)* | `mcptt/McpttSdp.kt` | `SdpTest`; S2–S5 |
| Floor control packets (RTCP APP `MCPT`) | TS 24.380 §8 *(not checked locally)* | `mcptt/Floor.kt` | `FloorTest` (captured bytes) |
| Floor participant: request, grant, deny, taken, idle, revoke, release, acknowledgements, T100/T101 | TS 24.380 §6.2.4 *(not checked locally)* | `mcptt/FloorParticipant.kt` | `FloorParticipantTest`; S2–S5, S4 (deny), S9 (retransmission) |
| RTP with the SSRC from Floor Granted; AMR-WB in bandwidth-efficient or octet-aligned form, CMR 15 | RFC 3550, RFC 4867 §4.3–4.4 | `media/Rtp.kt`, `media/AmrWb.kt`, `MediaSession.talk` | `MediaTest`; S2–S11 (payloads identical end to end) |
| AMR-WB encoding and decoding | TS 26.171, 26.201 | `app/…/media/MediaCodecAmrWb.kt` | `MediaCodecAmrWbTest` (redroid and AVD) |
| Playout with a jitter buffer and loss concealment | — | `media/JitterBuffer.kt`, `MediaSession` | `JitterBufferTest`; S9 |

## MCData

|---|---|---|---|
| SDS SIGNALLING PAYLOAD, DATA PAYLOAD and SDS NOTIFICATION codecs | TS 24.282 §15.1.2, §15.1.4, §15.1.5, §15.2 | `mcdata/Messages.kt` | `MessagesTest` (the contract's worked hex examples) |
| mcdata-info in schema order | TS 24.282 Annex D.1 | `mcdata/McdataInfo.kt` | `McdataInfoTest` |
| One-to-one standalone SDS: MESSAGE to the PSI with mcdata-info, resource-lists, signalling and payload | TS 24.282 §9.2.2.2.1 | `McdataService.send` | S6 |
| Group standalone SDS, with the client ID | TS 24.282 §9.2.2.2.1 step 3 | `McdataService.send` | S6 |
| Payload limit on the signalling plane | TS 24.282 §9.2.1.1 | `McdataService.send` | Not exercised (local refusal) |
| Receiving: sender from `mcdata-calling-user-id`, group from `mcdata-calling-group-id`, 200 OK, deduplication by message ID | TS 24.282 §9.2.2.2.2, §9.2.1.2 | `McdataService.received` | S6 |

| Receiving notifications, several per MESSAGE (aggregated) | TS 24.282 §12.2.1.2 | `McdataService.handle` | S6 (the group case) |

## Android integration

| Requirement | Code | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Self-managed telecom calls (audio routing, headset answer and end) | `app/…/telecom/TelecomBridge.kt` | `TelecomTest` on an AVD (incoming and outgoing go ACTIVE). Redroid's Telecom has no telephony service, so S11 only records the telecom state |
| Foreground service types: special use when idle; phone call and microphone during a call | `McxService.foreground` | S11 (`0x40000000` → `0x40000084` → `0x40000000`) |
| Incoming-call CallStyle notification with a full-screen intent; message notifications | `Notifications.kt` | S11 (message notification) |
| PTT from the screen, headset and handset PTT key broadcasts; with no call, PTT calls the selected group | `Engine.ptt`, `input/PttKeyReceiver.kt`, `MainActivity` | `ScreensTest.pttIsPressAndHold`; S11 (key broadcast) |
| History that survives process death | `data/HistoryStore.kt` | S11 |
| Display indication when a message is shown | `ui/Screens.kt` `MessagesScreen` | `ScreensTest.messagesAreSentAndNewOnesMarkedDisplayed` |

## Deviations and limits

- **Server-driven choices** (see the wire contracts):
  - An explicit floor request; `mc_implicit_request` is refused.
  - No `mc_queueing`, because the lab disables queueing.
  - One AMR-WB frame per RTP packet.
  - UPDATE rather than re-INVITE for session refresh.
  - `mcptt-client-id` in every INVITE.
  - SIP-If-Match on every re-publication.
  - The IdMS login is the lab's credential POST.
- **Not implemented:**
  - pre-established sessions
  - emergency, imminent peril and broadcast calls
  - MCData on the media plane (MSRP), file distribution and data streaming
  - end-to-end media and floor protection (TS 33.180 keys)
  - off-network operation
  - queueing (T104, T132)
- **Plan changes:**
  - The interactive login follows RFC 8252 directly (Custom Tab and loopback redirect), not through the AppAuth library.
    The core already had the OIDC logic, so the library would have added nothing.
  - History uses SQLite, not Room, to avoid an annotation processor in the build.
- **NAT:** the MCPTT server does not latch media and checks the SDP address, so the UE must be directly reachable for
  UDP. The lab puts every Android client on the server network. Clients behind NAT need server support that OpenMCX
  lacks.
- **Flow reuse at the SIP core** is a lab overlay (`lab/androidlab.py`), not part of the OpenMCX configuration.
